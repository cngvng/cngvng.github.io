Thank you for visiting my website!

======
I am an undergraduate student at [Phenikaa University](https://phenikaa-uni.edu.vn/en), where I am studying computer science and a research student at [AIoT Lab](https://aiot.phenikaa-uni.edu.vn/), under the guidance of [Dr. Luong Van Thien](https://tvluong.wordpress.com/).

My work revolves around image processing, and building computer vision models to solve real-world problems such as: Face attendance, abnormal pixel recognition, ... I am very interested in the Generative model, because its potential is so great that it has not been fully exploited.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books and playing soccer and many other interesting things.
