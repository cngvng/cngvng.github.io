## Objective

Seeking a **PhD postion** to further explore cutting-edge AI techniques.

## Research Background

* **Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA):** Designing and evaluating JEPA-based models to learn compressed, predictive representations across language, vision, and structured data
* **Agentic AI & AGI:** Architecting multi-agent frameworks that collaborate, adapt, and learn to solve complex tasks autonomously.
* **Scalability & Security of LLMs:** Quantization, self-hosting, and DevOps pipelines for private, low-latency, and
cost-effective inference at scale.
