🚀 I’m Tuan-Cuong Vuong, an AI Engineer passionate about building systems that *learn, adapt,* and *elevate human potential*. I specialize in Generative AI (GenAI) and intelligent system deployment, currently working full-time at **BSM Labs**.

💡 My work lies at the intersection of **AI research and real-world application**—from GenAI servers that learn with you, to adaptive education systems that personalize learning paths, and smart healthcare tools that assist clinicians with contextual understanding. I’m especially interested in *multi-agent collaboration, fine-tuning LLMs, and serving AI at scale.*

🛠️ What I build:
- **GenAI Servers** with supervised adaptive learning and document-grounded chat
- **Customer & Patient Assistants** using LLMs for context-aware consulting
- **Smart Platforms** for education, medical diagnostics, and data automation

🎓 I study Computer Science at **Phenikaa University**, majoring in Data Science & AI, where I research and prototype systems that connect AI with human-centric design.

📍Previously at:
- **Phenikaa X** – Intelligent education platforms and custom LLM services
- **AIoT Lab** – Applied research in adaptive learning and smart health
- **Project X Vietnam** – Researching human-like cognition in AI

Let’s connect if you're working on **LLM applications**, **agent-based AI**, or **AI for social good**. I'm always open to a meaningful conversation.
