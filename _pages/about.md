🚀 I'm Tuan-Cuong Vuong, an AI Engineer passionate about building systems that *learn, adapt,* and *elevate human potential*. I specialize in Generative AI (GenAI) and intelligent system deployment, currently working full-time at **BSM Labs**, and Research Assistant at **AIoT Labs**

💡 My work lies at the intersection of **AI research and real-world application**—from GenAI servers that learn with you, to adaptive education systems that personalize learning paths, and smart healthcare tools that assist clinicians with contextual understanding. I'm especially interested in *multi-agent collaboration, fine-tuning LLMs, and serving AI at scale.*

🛠️ What I build:
- **GenAI Servers** with supervised adaptive learning and document-grounded chat
- **Customer & Patient Assistants** using LLMs for context-aware consulting
- **Smart Platforms** for education, medical diagnostics, and data automation
- **Domain-specific Language Models** like BERT-VBD for Vietnamese banking applications
- **UAV Communication Networks** with optimization algorithms for enhanced performance

🎓 I study Computer Science at **Phenikaa University**, majoring in Data Science & AI, where I research and prototype systems that connect AI with human-centric design. My research has been published in IEEE Access and presented at international conferences including CITA 2024 (Da Nang) and NOLTA 2024 (Ha Long).

📍Professional Experience:
- **BSM Labs** (2024-Present) – AI Engineer developing GenAI systems and LLM applications
- **AIoT Lab, Phenikaa University** (2022-Present) – Research Assistant in multi agent collaboration
- **Phenikaa X** (2023-2024) – AI Research Engineer focusing on intelligent education platforms

🏆 **Recent Achievements:**
- Nominee for Student Best Paper Awards in CITA2024 
- Viet Nam Informatics Olympiad consolation prize 2023 
- JASSO Scholarship for International Students in Japan 
- Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference Scholarship

Let's connect if you're working on **LLM applications**, **agent-based AI**, **domain-specific AI models**, or **AI for social good**. I'm always open to meaningful conversations about advancing AI research and applications.
