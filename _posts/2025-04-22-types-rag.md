Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm in modern AI systems, combining the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. This survey explores the various types and architectures of RAG systems that have been developed to address different use cases and challenges in natural language processing.

## 1. Basic RAG (Vanilla RAG)

The fundamental RAG architecture consists of a retriever component that fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base and a generator that produces responses based on both the query and retrieved context.

**Key Components:**
- **Retriever**: Dense retrieval using BERT-based encoders
- **Knowledge Base**: Static document collection
- **Generator**: Transformer-based language model (e.g., T5, BART)

## 2. Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD)

FiD processes multiple retrieved passages independently in the encoder and fuses information in the decoder, allowing for more effective integration of diverse sources.

## 7. Self-RAG

Self-RAG represents a significant advancement in retrieval-augmented generation by incorporating metacognitive capabilities that allow the model to assess and improve its own performance. This architecture introduces special reflection tokens that enable the model to critique its retrievals, verify factual accuracy, and determine when additional information is needed.

![Self-RAG Framework](https://selfrag.github.io/static/images/teaser_self_rag_v8.png)
*Image source: arXiv - Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection*

**Technical Architecture:**

The Self-RAG framework operates through four distinct reflection tokens:
- **Retrieve**: Determines whether retrieval is necessary for the current segment
- **IsRel**: Evaluates the relevance of retrieved passages to the query
- **IsSup**: Assesses whether the generated content is supported by the retrieved evidence
- **IsUse**: Judges the overall utility and quality of the generated response

**Training Methodology:**

Self-RAG employs a multi-stage training approach:
1. **Retrieval Decision Learning**: Training the model to decide when retrieval is beneficial
2. **Relevance Assessment**: Learning to evaluate passage relevance through contrastive learning
3. **Attribution Training**: Teaching the model to ground responses in retrieved evidence
4. **Quality Evaluation**: Developing criteria for response utility and factual accuracy

**Performance Characteristics:**

- **Accuracy Improvement**: 15-30% better factual accuracy compared to standard RAG
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Significant decrease in unsupported claims
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Dynamic retrieval based on query complexity
- **Computational Overhead**: 20-40% increase in inference time due to reflection mechanisms

**Use Cases:**
