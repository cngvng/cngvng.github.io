This is my #1 blog, it is a story or sharing about my experiences during my first year of research as a freshman.


Introduction
======
Similar to the purpose of this blog, I aim to share my experiences as a first-year research student - a time when nobody thought I could do it. However, I persisted and continue to pursue my research dream. For those pursuing a similar field, I challenge you to take the leap, to have the courage to try, to do, and to follow your aspirations from the start. I invite you to listen to my stories and share your thoughts with me via the social media links provided on the left side of the screen.

My determination to succeed and pursue research as a career began as a first-year student, and I believe that anyone can achieve their goals if they have the courage and perseverance to follow their dreams. By sharing my experiences, I hope to inspire and motivate others to pursue their passions and make a meaningful impact in their fields.

I look forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts and engaging in thought-provoking discussions about research and the journey towards success.

Opportunity
======
Prior to attending university, I had little to no knowledge about research, especially within my current major. Fortunately, during my first class meeting, Dr. Luong Van Thien shared fascinating research stories, which sparked my interest and led me to explore this intriguing avenue. I eagerly applied to work in his lab and was overjoyed to be accepted. The experience was made even more special when I discovered that my participation in the lab allowed me to compete in the Faculty of Science Competition - a truly memorable beginning, despite the challenges that come with being a young student. Through my participation in research, I have gained invaluable knowledge and practical experience that has helped shape my future aspirations.
