## What is Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol?

A2A is an open protocol that lets AI agents talk to each other, no matter who made them or how. Think of it as a **universal translator** for AI agents from different companies and frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, and LlamaIndex.

Google released A2A in early April 2025 at Google Cloud Next. They created it with help from **over 50 technology partners**, including big companies like Atlassian, Salesforce, SAP, and MongoDB. This means A2A isn't just Google's idea—it's an industry-wide effort toward standardization.

At its core, A2A treats each AI agent like a networked service with a standard interface. It's similar to how websites use HTTP to communicate, but for AI agents instead. Just like MCP solves the NxM problem, A2A makes it easy to connect different agents without writing custom code for each pair.

### The Problem: Siloed Agents in a Collaborative World

Before A2A, AI agents were like islands. Each one had its own language and interface, making it hard for them to work together. It was like trying to talk to someone who speaks a different language.

Imagine this workflow:
1. A customer service chatbot (Agent A, Framework X) finds a complex technical issue
2. It needs to check a product knowledge base (Agent B, Framework Y) for information
3. Agent B checks logs and finds a specific software version causing the problem
4. It needs to contact a support agent (Agent C, Framework Z) to handle the issue

**Without A2A, each agent would need custom code to talk to the others**. This "silo" problem blocks innovation and limits multi-agent systems. We need agents to:

- **Discover**: Find other agents and know what they can do
- **Communicate**: Share information (text, data, files) clearly
- **Coordinate**: Handle tasks with multiple steps and multiple agents
- **Negotiate**: Agree on how to interact (text, forms, audio)
- **Secure**: Interact safely with proper authentication

### The Solution: A2A Protocol

A2A solves these challenges by providing a standard interface. Key benefits include:

- **Openness**: A2A is an open protocol—anyone can implement or improve it
- **Interoperability**: Agents can talk regardless of their technology or vendor
- **Task-Oriented**: Communication uses "Tasks" for tracking work clearly
- **Capability Discovery**: Agents advertise their skills via standardized "Agent Cards"
- **Rich Data Exchange**: Supports various data types (text, JSON, forms, files)
- **Flexibility**: Works with different interaction patterns (request-response, streaming, webhooks)
- **Security**: Built-in support for authentication and authorization

### A2A interaction flow

Discovery Phase: Imagine a user asking their main AI agent, “Can you help me plan a business trip to Tokyo next month?” The AI they’re interacting with recognizes the need to find specialized agents for flights, hotels, and local activities. To begin, the client agent (the one they’re talking with) identifies remote agents that can help with each task. It retrieves the remote agents’ Agent Cards to learn whether they’re a good fit for the job.

Task Initiation: With the team assembled, it’s time to assign jobs. Picture the client agent saying to the agent specializing in travel booking, “Find flights to Tokyo from May 15th to the 20th.” The client sends a request to the server’s endpoint (typically a POST to /taskssend), creating a new task with a unique ID. This includes the initial message detailing what the client wants the server to do. 

Processing: The booking specialist agent (server/remote agent) starts searching available flights matching the criteria. It might take one of several actions:

- Complete the task immediately and return an artifact: “Here are the available flights.”
- Request more information (setting the state to input-required): “Do you prefer a specific airline?”
- Begin working on a long-running task (setting state to working): “I’m comparing rates to find you the best deal.”

Multi-Turn Conversations: If more information is needed, the client and server exchange additional messages. The server might ask clarifying questions (“Are connections okay?”), and the client responds (“No, direct flights only.”), all within the context of the same task ID.

Status Updates: For tasks that take time to complete, A2A supports several notification mechanisms:

- Polling: The client periodically checks the task status
- Server-Sent Events (SSE): The server streams real-time updates if the client is subscribed
- Push notifications: The server can POST updates to a callback URL if provided

Task Completion: When finished, the server marks the task as completed and returns an artifact containing the results. Alternatively, it might mark the task as failed if it encountered problems, or canceled if the task was terminated.

In short, A2A doesn’t simply let AI agents chat about a shared task. It empowers many agents to contribute and collaborate toward the same goal, while a client agent assembles a result greater than the sum of its parts.

## What Is MCP and How Does It Work?

MCP lays out clear rules for how AI can find, connect to, and use external tools – whether it’s querying a database or running a command. This lets models go beyond their training data, making them more flexible and aware of the world around them.

The best place to start is the official MCP documentation and repository. Anthropic open-sourced the spec and provided SDKs (in languages like Python and now even Java). The steps typically are:

- Run or install an MCP server for the tool or data source you care about. Anthropic has an open-source repo of pre-built servers for popular systems (Google Drive, Slack, Git, databases, etc.). You can install these and configure them (often just running a command with your credentials or keys).
- Set up the MCP client in your AI app. If you’re using Claude’s app, you can add the server in the UI. If you’re coding your own agent, use the MCP SDK to connect to the server (providing the address/port).
- Once you’ve enabled the MCP services in your client, the client will pick on the additional functionality provided: additional tools, resources and prompt templates.
- Invoke and iterate. The model/agent can now call the MCP tool actions as needed. Make sure to monitor logs to see that it’s calling the servers correctly. You’ll see requests hitting the MCP server and responses coming back.

## A2A vs. MCP: Complementary, not competitive

Even though A2A and MCP might seem like they’re vying for the same space, they’re actually designed to work together. They address different (and complementary) aspects of AI integration.

 ![Technical Overview of MCP](/images/blog_posts/2025-16-04-img3.png "Technical Overview of MCP")

1. MCP connects LLMs (or agents) to tools and data sources (vertical integration)
2. A2A connects agents to other agents (horizontal integration)

Google deliberately positioned A2A as complementary to MCP. To emphasize this pluralistic design philosophy, Google launched their Vertex AI agent builder with built-in MCP support on the same day A2A released. While this certainly helps Google get their technology in front of more devs, this is far from a marketing-centric move; it makes perfect technical sense.

Here’s a useful analogy to illustrate that point: If MCP is what enables agents to use tools, then A2A is their conversation while they work. MCP equips individual agents with capabilities, while A2A helps them coordinate those capabilities as a team.

In a comprehensive setup, an agent might use MCP to pull information from a database, then use A2A to pass that information to another agent for analysis. The two protocols can work together to create a more complete solution for complex tasks, while simplifying the development hurdles we’ve faced since LLMs first became mainstream.

## The future of the Agent2Agent protocol

Looking ahead, we can expect further improvement to A2A, as outlined in the protocol’s roadmap. Planned enhancements include:

- Formalized authorization schemes and optional credentials directly within Agent Cards
- Dynamic UX negotiation within ongoing tasks (like adding audio/video mid-conversation)
- Improved streaming performance and push notification mechanics

But perhaps the most interesting long-term possibility is that A2A will become for agent development what HTTP was for web communication: a spark that lights an explosion of innovation. As adoption grows, we might see pre-packaged “teams” of agents specialized for particular industries, and eventually, a seamless global network of AI agents that your client can tap into.

For developers and organizations exploring AI implementation, now is the perfect time to learn and build. Together, A2A and MCP are the beginning of a more standardized, secure, and enterprise-ready approach to AI.
