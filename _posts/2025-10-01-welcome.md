Welcome to my research blog! I'm excited to launch this platform where I'll share insights, updates, and thoughts about my work in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:

- **Research Updates**: Regular updates about my ongoing research projects, including preliminary findings and new directions
- **Technical Tutorials**: In-depth guides and tutorials on machine learning techniques, tools, and best practices
- **Paper Reviews**: Critical analysis and summaries of influential papers in AI/ML
- **Conference Reports**: Summaries and highlights from conferences I attend
- **Thoughts on AI**: Reflections on the broader implications of AI technology and research trends

## My Research Focus

My work primarily focuses on:

1. **Multimodal Learning**: Developing systems that can understand and integrate information from multiple modalities (vision, language, audio)
2. **Explainable AI**: Creating interpretable machine learning models, particularly for high-stakes applications like healthcare
3. **Robustness and Security**: Improving the reliability and security of deep learning systems against adversarial attacks
4. **AI for Healthcare**: Applying machine learning to medical imaging and clinical decision support
