Teaching Philosophy
======
My teaching approach emphasizes practical understanding through real-world examples. Each theoretical concept is paired with concrete applications and hands-on exercises. I encourage students to think critically about AI technologies â€“ not just how they work, but their broader implications for society and various industries.

Assessment Methods
======
* Practical programming assignments (40%)
* Midterm examination covering core concepts (20%)
* Final project addressing a real-world problem (30%)
* Class participation and discussion (10%)

Learning Outcomes
======
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Explain key AI concepts, algorithms, and their appropriate applications
2. Implement basic AI solutions using Python and relevant libraries
3. Evaluate the performance and limitations of AI systems
4. Analyze ethical implications of AI deployment in various contexts
5. Design simple AI solutions for real-world problems
6. Communicate effectively about AI technologies to technical and non-technical audiences
