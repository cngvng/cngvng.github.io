  Internet of Things (IoTs) has been playing an important role in many sectors, such as smart cities, 
  smart agriculture, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing. However, IoT devices are highly vulnerable 
  to cyber-attacks, which may result in security breaches and data leakages. To effectively prevent these 
  attacks, a variety of machine learning-based network intrusion detection methods for IoT networks have 
  been developed, which often rely on either feature extraction or feature selection techniques for reducing 
  the dimension of input data before being fed into machine learning models. This aims to make the detection 
  complexity low enough for real-time operations, which is particularly vital in any intrusion detection 
  systems. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between these two feature reduction methods of 
  intrusion detection in terms of various performance metrics, namely, precision rate, recall rate, 
  detection accuracy, as well as runtime complexity.

## Abstract

Internet of Things (IoTs) has been playing an important role in many sectors, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing. However, IoT devices are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which may result in security breaches and data leakages. To effectively prevent these attacks, a variety of machine learning-based network intrusion detection methods for IoT networks have been developed, which often rely on either feature extraction or feature selection techniques for reducing the dimension of input data before being fed into machine learning models.

This aims to make the detection complexity low enough for real-time operations, which is particularly vital in any intrusion detection systems. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between these two feature reduction methods of intrusion detection in terms of various performance metrics, namely, precision rate, recall rate, detection accuracy, as well as runtime complexity.
